                  Boxes should be securely taped on all sides.
                  To ensure that your items are protected during storage, anything fragile inside your boxes should be secured properly. Do not over pack boxes or store food and liquids.
                  Large furniture or appliances going into storage do not have to be put into a box as they are usually too large. We will supply labels for you upon pick-up.
                  Plastic bins or non-EPIC boxes that are used to store your belongings are treated as a standard box. You can find pricing or add these items to your order on the service page.
                  Beds and furniture must be placed in a nonstandard size box and securely taped. We will supply labels for you upon pick-up if the items are too large for a box.
                  Refrigerators must be thoroughly defrosted and cleaned prior to pick up or there will be a defrosting fee.
                  All electronics and anything fragile must have 2-4 inches of packing material (bubble wrap, moving blankets or original factory packaging) on all sides of the item. The items must be placed in a sturdy cardboard box that we will provide upon ordering.
                  All boxes and items going into storage must be labeled with your name, and a number sequence. Our team will number each box and item upon pick-up. We will supply labels for all non-boxed items.
                  Do not tape items together that should be stored separately.
